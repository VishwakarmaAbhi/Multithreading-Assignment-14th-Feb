    "\n",
    "1. `run()`: This method defines the entry point of the thread's activity. It is called when the `start()` method of the `Thread` object is invoked. You can override this method in a subclass to define the specific behavior of the thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `start()`: This method starts the execution of the thread by invoking its `run()` method. Once started, the thread begins executing concurrently with other threads in the program. It must be called to begin the execution of the thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `join()`: This method blocks the calling thread until the thread on which it is called completes its execution. It waits for the associated thread to finish and then continues execution. It is commonly used to ensure that all threads complete their execution before the program continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `isAlive()`: This method returns a boolean value indicating whether the thread is currently alive or not. A thread is considered alive if it has been started but has not yet completed its execution. This method can be used to check the status of a thread and determine if it is still running.\n",

    "Certainly! Here are the advantages and disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Performance**: Multithreading allows for concurrent execution of tasks, which can lead to improved performance by utilizing multiple CPU cores efficiently. This can result in faster execution of programs and better resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enhanced Responsiveness**: Multithreading can enhance the responsiveness of applications, particularly in scenarios where tasks need to run concurrently with user interactions. For example, in graphical user interfaces (GUIs), multithreading can prevent the UI from freezing while performing resource-intensive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resource Sharing**: Threads within the same process can share resources such as memory, files, and sockets. This enables efficient communication and data sharing between different parts of a program, leading to better resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simplified Programming Model**: Multithreading simplifies the development of certain types of applications, such as servers and concurrent data processing systems. It allows developers to write concurrent code more easily by dividing tasks into separate threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complexity and Difficulty**: Multithreaded programming introduces complexities such as race conditions, deadlocks, and synchronization issues. Writing correct and efficient multithreaded code requires careful design and implementation, which can be challenging for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Concurrency Issues**: Multithreading can introduce concurrency issues such as race conditions, where the outcome of execution depends on the timing of thread execution. These issues can lead to unpredictable behavior and bugs that are difficult to diagnose and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overhead**: Multithreading introduces overhead in terms of thread creation, context switching, and synchronization. This overhead can degrade performance, especially in scenarios where the number of threads exceeds the available CPU cores or where threads compete for shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Difficulty in Debugging**: Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging due to non-deterministic behavior and timing-dependent issues. Identifying and fixing concurrency bugs requires specialized debugging techniques and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while multithreading offers benefits such as improved performance and responsiveness, it also comes with challenges and complexities that need to be carefully managed during software development."

    "Deadlocks and race conditions are common concurrency issues that can occur in multithreaded programs. Here's an explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deadlock**:\n",
    "   - A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources that they need.\n",
    "   - Deadlocks typically occur in situations involving multiple locks or resources, where each thread holds one resource and waits for another resource held by another thread.\n",
    "   - Deadlocks can occur due to improper synchronization mechanisms, such as using multiple locks in different orders across threads.\n",
    "   - Deadlocks can lead to a program becoming unresponsive or freezing, as the threads involved are unable to make progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Race Condition**:\n",
    "   - A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing or interleaving of operations performed by multiple threads.\n",
    "   - Race conditions typically arise when multiple threads access shared resources or variables concurrently without proper synchronization.\n",
    "   - The outcome of a race condition is non-deterministic and depends on factors such as the scheduling of threads and the timing of operations.\n",
    "   - Race conditions can lead to unexpected and incorrect behavior in a program, such as incorrect results, data corruption, or crashes.\n",
    "   - Common examples of race conditions include read-modify-write operations on shared variables and operations involving critical sections without proper locking.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, deadlocks and race conditions are both concurrency issues that can occur in multithreaded programs. Deadlocks involve threads being blocked indefinitely due to circular dependencies on resources, while race conditions involve non-deterministic behavior due to concurrent access to shared resources without proper synchronization. Both issues can lead to program failures and need to be carefully addressed during software development."
